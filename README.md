## About the Project

Grackl is an online tracking interface for City of Austin Digital Projects. This effort is a partnership between the City of Austinâ€™s [Communications and Technology Management](https://www.austintexas.gov/techreport/communications-and-technology-management) department and the [Office of Innovation](https://cityofaustin.github.io/innovation/). This effort is also a commitment the City of Austin has made as part of its participation in the [Open Government Partnership subnational pilot program](https://opengovpartnership.bloomfire.com/posts/1315600-austin-s-open-government-partnership-action-plan).

### Getting Started

1. Clone and `cd` into repo root directory.

4. To run a static server: `gatsby develop`

### Tech Dependencies

Grackl is build using Gatsby.js. Gatsby is a static-site generator (similar to Jekyll.rb) that uses React ES6 components instead of Ruby and Liquid templates. [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/)

In addition to Gatsby, Grackl uses Netlify CMS.

// TODO: Add info about Netlify
